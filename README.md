# buttonclicker

A simple button clicker that can be run straight from the console. I originally made it to stop servers for kicking me for being afk.
It doesn't actually accomplish this yet so I'll experiment with ways to do this.

python3 app.py 
  [key]: the key that the program will push
  <interval>: how long in seconds before the program will push the button again. If not defined than 1 is used
  <random interval y/n>: if enabled than a random interval between 1 and your interval.
